# Cybersecurity Portfolio

A personal portfolio site built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), showcasing cybersecurity projects and skills.

Currently hosted on a netlify subdomain - [thaihuy.netlify.app](https://thaihuy.netlify.app/), looking to register my domain soon.

Inspired by [Sylvan Franklin](https://sylvanfranklin.com/)

## Details
The goal was to create a static site that is lightweight, in the end some Javascript made its way in but the result was stellar enough (5KB main page)

Font choices: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", Courier New, monospace
## Usage (Not sure why someone would want to build my portfolio  but sure)
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Build with `npm run build`
- Serve the `_site` folder

## Structure
- Source: `src/`
- Output: `_site/`
